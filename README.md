# The Unofficial New Penguin Russian Course Companion Site

**DISCLAIMER:** This site is not affiliated with Penguin or the author of The New Penguin Russian Course Textbook (Nicholas J. Brown).

The New Penguin Russian Course textbook is probably the most recommended textbook for new English-speaking learners but its biggest critique is the lack of accompanying audio.

As someone using the book to learn, it was also _my_ biggest gripe. So I developed this resource with my friend to provide an easy-to-use site with matching audios :D
