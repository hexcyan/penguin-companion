Welcome to this site! This is the first of many(?) devlog posts where I'll log the dev progress of this site))

I finished up my original design in Figma all the way back at the beginning of April, but didn't really work on it until recently. I've changed things up a little bit since the original design.

working on and off on the different components

not quite finished yet with all of them but happy enough to release this MVP
think ive covered most of the features that I wanted to include

alongside content for Chapters 1 and 3

collect some feedback and suggestions

Very happy with how
