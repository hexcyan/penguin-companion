Welcome to this site! This is the first of many(?) devlog posts where I'll log the dev progress of this site))

I finished up my [original design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/XnjevMcZb67ikso11Zoscp/New-Penguin-Russian-Course-Companion-Site) all the way back at the beginning of April, and have slowly been working on and off on each of the components (with the bulk of it recently lol). I've changed things up a little bit since the original design.

Not quite finished yet but think I've covered most of the features I wanted to include in an MVP, alongside content for Chapters 1 and 3.

Some things I will be working on adding:

-   [ ] Outline + Anchor Links for navigation
-   [ ] Dark Mode
-   [ ] Mobile friendly view
-   [ ] Toggleable sidebar

The full [tracker can be found here](/devlog/tracker). (really messy rn i will clean it up soon :tm:)

collect some feedback and suggestions

Very happy with how
