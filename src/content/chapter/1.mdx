Before you finish this lesson you’ll be able to pronounce the Russian heading above, which means ‘the Russian alphabet’.

### 1.1 The Russian Cyrillic Alphabet

Russian Cyrillic is based on an alphabet invented around ad 863 by a Macedonian monk, who spoke a South Slavonic language closely related to Russian and also knew Greek; the inventor was later canonized as Saint Cyril, hence the name Cyrillic. This original Slavonic alphabet was based on the Greek one, so some of the letters will be familiar, e.g. n, the Russian p, which you may recognize as the Greek pi, used in mathematics.

The alphabet is the first hurdle when you tackle Russian, but it is not a daunting one. Once you know the sounds of the thirty-three letters, you can read Russian words comprehensibly; unlike English, it is generally true to say that Russian words are pronounced as they are written. In this lesson, you will learn the essentials for reading and pronouncing Russian. In Lesson 2, you will find details of the regular minor differences between Russian spelling and pronunciation.

### 1.2 Learning the Russian Alphabet

To make thirty-three letters easier to learn, we’ll divide them into four groups.

(a) The first group contains five letters which are easy to learn:

|  Capital  |  Small  | Pronounciation         |
| :-------: | :-----: | :--------------------- |
|     А     |    а    | [a] as in f**a**ther   |
|     К     |    к    | [k] as in **k**angaroo |
|     М     |    м    | [m] as in **m**an      |
|     О     |    о    | [o] as in b**o**ttle   |
|     Т     |    т    | [t] as in **t**an      |

So you can read Russian words such as:
<table>
    <WordRow word="тот"/>
    <WordRow word="кот"/>
    <WordRow word="так"/>
    <WordRow word="там"/>
    <WordRow word="кто-то"/>
</table>

(b) The second group contains seven letters which look like English ones but have different sounds:

|  Capital  |  Small  | Pronounciation         |
| :-------: | :-----: | :--------------------- |
|     В     |    в    | [v] as in **v**et      |
|     Е     |    е    | [ye] as in **ye**s     |
|     Н     |    н    | [n] as in **n**ever    |
|     Р     |    р    | [r] as in e**rr**or*   |
|     С     |    с    | [t] as in **t**an      |
|     У     |    у    | [t] as in **t**an      |
|     Х     |    х    | [t] as in **t**an      |

<table>
    <WordRow word="нет"/>
    <WordRow word="метро"/>
    <WordRow word="он"/>
    <WordRow word="она"/>
    <WordRow word="сестра"/>
    <WordRow word="ресторан"/>
</table>



Words for practice:

нет

Москва

метро

он

сестра

ресторан

Now try these ones, covering the pronunciation on the right with a piece of paper:

сахар

вам

Вера

уиро

Нева

касса

карта

марка

It is worth going through these lists twice, since you will meet all these useful words again.

(c) The third group contains thirteen letters which look unfamiliar but have familiar sounds:

Examples:

мир

да

футбол

(d) The last group contains eight letters which take longer to learn:

| Capital | Small | Pronounciation |
| ------- | ----- | -------------- |
| Ж       | ж     | [zh]           |
| Ц       | ц     | [ts]           |
| Ч       | ч     |                |
| Ш       | ш     |                |
| Щ       | щ     |                |
| Ъ       | ъ     |                |
| Ы       | ы     |                |
| Ь       | ь     |                |
